MapOSMatic is a web application to generate maps of cities or towns,
including index of streets, from OpenStreetMap data.

It is made of two components:

 * maposmatic, the web front-end. An application written using the
   Django framework allows to submit and visualize map rendering jobs.
   The rendering is done in the background by a daemon;

 * ocitysmap, the back-end that generates the map. It is available as a
   Python module, used both by the maposmatic daemon (above) and by a
   sample command line application.

This source tree contains maposmatic, the web front-end.

Translation
===========

The .po files are stored in www/locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/. To
generate or update a .po file:

  cd www/maposmatic
  ../../manage.py makemessages --no-wrap -a # for all locales

or

  cd www/maposmatic
  ../../manage.py makemessages --no-wrap -l xx_XX # for one locale

Then, edit the .po file manually, or using a graphical tool such as
poedit (available in the Debian/Ubuntu package of the same name). Once
done, don't forget to compile the .po file into an .mo file using:

  ../../manage.py compilemessages
