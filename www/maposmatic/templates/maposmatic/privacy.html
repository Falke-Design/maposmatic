<h2>{% trans "Encryption" %}</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  All web traffic is encrypted using TLS/SSL, using certificates
  provided by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a>.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  When trying to access the site via unencrypted <tt>http:</tt>
  URLs you'll automatically be redirected to the encrypted <tt>https:</tt>
  URL counterparts.

<h2>Logging</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The web server only logs date and time, requested URL and HTTP status,
  it does normally not log IP addresses, user agent strings or referer URLs.
  These additional fields may temporary be added to log entries when necessary
  to analyze problems (although so far that has never been needed), but such
  additional access logs will be removed again within 24 hours.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  When submitting an actual map rendering job, your IP address will
  {% endblocktrans %}
  {% if SUBMITTER_IP_LIFETIME < 0 %}
    {% blocktrans %}
    be stored until removed manually
    {% endblocktrans %}
  {% elif SUBMITTER_IP_LIFETIME == 0 %}
    {% blocktrans %}
    not be stored
    {% endblocktrans %}
  {% else %}
    {% blocktrans %}
    stored for {{SUBMITTER_IP_LIFETIME}} hours
    {% endblocktrans %}
  {% endif %}
  {% blocktrans %}
  along with the actual map request.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  If you chose to also provide an email address for notification when
  your request has been processed completely, this mail address will
  be stored
  {% endblocktrans %}
  {% if SUBMITTER_MAIL_LIFETIME > 0 %}
    {% blocktrans %}
    for {{ SUBMITTER_MAIL_LIFETIME }} hours.
    {% endblocktrans %}
  {% else %}
    {% blocktrans %}
    until removed manually.

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  This site may use up to three cookies to store information about you:
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt class="badge badge-secondary">cookielaw_accepted</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      This cooke gets created as soon as you click
      <span class="badge badge-success">Accept</span>
      on the cookie warning. After this you will not
      see that warning again on this browser until
      the cookie gets deleted by you, or expires after
      ten years.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      The cookie only stores a fixed valie of "1" to
      remember your acceptance.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      If you do not accept this cookie the cookie
      warning block will appear every time you load
      a new page from the site, but it will not otherwise
      affect functionality of the site apart from the
      screen space taken.
      {% endblocktrans %}
  </dd>
  <dt><tt class="badge badge-secondary">sessionid</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      This cookie is used to tie your browser session to
      some session specific information stored on the server
      side.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      So far we use a session only to store and remember
      certain choices you made in the 
      <span class="badge badge-success">Create Map</span>
      form, so that we can pre-select or pre-fill form
      elements accordingly the next time you create
      a map.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      So the information stored in the session is just
      for your own convenience, it is not tracked in
      any way, it does not include any personal information
      about you, and the information will be removed
      completely two weeks after your last access of the
      <span class="badge badge-success">Create Map</span>
      form.      
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      If you decide to not accept this cookie the functionality
      of the site will not be affected, you will just loose
      the form prefill convenice.
      {% endblocktrans %}

  <dt><tt class="badge badge-secondary">_osm_topt_token</tt></dt>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      This cookie may get set by the OpenStreetMap tile servers
      providing the map tiles used in the interactive map in the
      <span class="badge badge-success">Create Map</span> form.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      This cookie stores
      <a href="https://operations.osmfoundation.org/2017/01/31/january.html"
	 >a time-based one-time password token
      which can be verified by the OpenStreetMap tile cache servers</a>
      and so can improve tile access performance. 
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      To the best of our knowledge this cookie is not used by
      OpenStreetMap to perform tracking of any kind.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      If you decide to not accept this cookie the map tiles
      in the interactive map may load slower, but otherwise
      the functionality of our site will not be reduced in
      any way.

<h2>Data from other sites</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  All images, style sheets, fonts and all javascript code
  are stored locally on this server. There will be no
  cross site requests to other sites when accessing this
  service, with one exception:
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The site uses map tiles provided by OpenStreetMap in the
  interactive map shown on the
  <span class="badge badge-success">Create Map</span>
  form. These are loaded from the OpenStreetMap tile
  servers under the <tt>tiles.openstreetmap.org</tt>
  subdomain by your browser directly.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Please refer to the
  <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy#Where_do_we_store_the_data"
     >OpenStreetMap Foundations Privacy Policy</a>
  regarding the access to those
  map tile images.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>Data uploaded by you</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The site allows you to upload GPX tracks, GeoJson files and
  <a href="umap.openstreetmap.fr">Umap</a> map exports to
  incorporate information stored in them into generated maps.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Note that all maps generated by this service are publicly
  visible, so do <strong>not</strong> upload any such files
  which contain information that should become visible to
  a global audience, no matter whether this is a problem
  for privacy, security, copyright, or other legal reasons.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  If you have uploaded such a file by accident, please inform
  {{ CONTACT_EMAIL }} via email and request a removal of the
  uploaded file and the generated map. Provide either the
  URL of the generated map page, or the file name of the
  uploaded file and the date it was uploaded to this site.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>Generated maps</h2>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  Generated maps are stored on the server for some time
  until they are finally removed again for storage space
  reasons. The actual rendering job data remains available
  though, and so the deleted map files can be regenerated
  at any time. 
  {% endblocktrans %}
<p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  If you think a map rendering job should be removed
  completely for whatever reason, please inform
  {{ CONTACT_EMAIL }} via email and provide the URL
  of the rendering job you want to have removed.
  {% endblocktrans %}
