<h2>Encryption</h2>

<p>
All web traffic is encrypted using TLS/SSL, using certificates provided by LetsEncrypt(url).
</p>

<p>
When trying to access the site via unencrypted http: URLs you'll automatically be redirected
to the encrypted https: URL counterparts.
</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>

<p>
The web server only logs date and time, requested URL and HTTP status, it does normally not log
IP addresses, user agent strings or referer URLs. These additional fields may temporary be added to log entries when necessary to analyze problems (although so far that has never been needed), but such additional access logs will be removed again within 24 hours.
</p>

<p>
When submitting an actual map rendering job, your IP address will
{% if SUBMITTER_IP_LIFETIME < 0 %}
be stored until removed manually
{% elif SUBMITTER_IP_LIFETIME == 0 %}
not be stored
{% else %}
stored for {{SUBMITTER_IP_LIFETIME}} hours
{% endif %}
along with the actual map request.
</p>

<p>
If you chose to also provide an email address for notification when
your request has been processed completely, this mail address will
be stored
{% if SUBMITTER_MAIL_LIFETIME > 0 %}
for {{ SUBMITTER_MAIL_LIFETIME }} hours.
{% else %}
until removed manually.
{% endif %}
</p>
